**Goom On-Line** is the Goom music visualizer ([SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/goom/)), created between 2001 and 2005 by Jean-Christophe Hoelt, now forked to turn it into a comfy web music player. And... it's right there, online. Just click the portal above!

# Donations

Ok, look, I didn't create Goom. Most of this is not mine. The author of Goom is Jean-Christophe Hoelt, and as there hasn't been much news for years, [I have no idea if he's actively taking the donations for which there is a seemingly-working button on this page](https://sourceforge.net/projects/goom/), but I am sure that he deserves them for Goom.

What I did was mostly just to bring up this interface that lets you use Goom on the web. Kind of like an attempt to make this piece of art known again. But sure enough, me also likes $. So if you were to insist on giving _me of all people_ something:

Thank you so much!
